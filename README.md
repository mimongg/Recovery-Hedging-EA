Automated Trading Strategy for MetaTrader 5
This Python script automates trading on MetaTrader 5 using technical analysis on the XAUUSD (Gold) symbol. The strategy leverages real-time price data, monitors market conditions within a specified time range, and dynamically opens and closes trades based on predefined profit/loss conditions.

Key Features
Session Control: The script activates trading logic only between 1:00 PM and 10:00 PM.
Market Order Execution: Automatically places buy or sell orders based on real-time market price movements.
Profit Management: Monitors open positions and closes trades when a set profit threshold is met across all positions.
Dynamic Position Sizing: Adjusts lot size after each trade, doubling on successful buy orders.
Error Handling: Includes fallback logic for retrying trades in case of execution failure.
How It Works
Session Time Check: The script checks the current time and only activates the trading session if it's between 1 PM and 10 PM.
Real-Time Price Monitoring: Retrieves the current bid and ask prices of XAUUSD to evaluate entry points.
Order Logic:
Sell Order: Placed when the bid price drops by 0.50 from the initial tick, with a stop loss of +2.00 and take profit of -1.00.
Buy Order: Placed when the ask price rises by 0.50 from the initial tick, with a stop loss of -2.00 and take profit of +1.00.
Profit Management: If the profit from all open positions exceeds 1.00 per position, the script closes all positions.
Dynamic Lot Size: Each time a successful trade is placed, the lot size increases for future trades to maximize gains.
